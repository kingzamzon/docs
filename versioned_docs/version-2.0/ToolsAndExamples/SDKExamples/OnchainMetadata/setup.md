# Setup the Project

## Smart Contract

1. Install hardhat:

```js
yarn add hardhat
```

2. Init hardhat to create the boilerplate for a **Basic project (with Javascript)**:

```js
npx hardhat init
```

3. Install Openzepplin:

```js
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
```

4. Test deploy the sample smart contract on 2 separate terminals:

```js
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Now that we have our hardhat working & the sample smart contract is deployed correctly, let's setup our Lit SDK, which we will use to encrypt & decrypt the metadata.

## Lit JS SDK V2

You can use the Lit JS SDK V2 to encrypt and store any static content. This could be a file, a string, or anything that won't change (we're going to encrypt an input string). You have to store the content and metadata yourself (we're storing that on a blockchain network), but Lit will store who is allowed to decrypt it and enforce this (aka key management).

1. Install Lit JS SDK V2:

```js
yarn add @lit-protocol/lit-node-client@serrano
```

2. Create a Lit class which will have all the encryption & decryption functions we require:

```js
import * as LitJsSdk from "@lit-protocol/lit-node-client@serrano";

const client = new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClient();

class Lit {
  litNodeClient;

  async connect() {
    await client.connect();
    this.litNodeClient = client;
  }
}
```

:::note

`client.connect()` will return a promise that resolves when you are connected to the Lit Network. You may also listen for the `lit-ready` event.

In this code example, the `litNodeClient` is set as a global variable for use throughout the web app.
