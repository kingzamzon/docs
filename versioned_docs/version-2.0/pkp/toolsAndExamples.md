# Initial Implementations

## Swap Playground
Uniswap trade interface for Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs). 
This is a demo to create actions that developers can copy and paste to use for their own projects. After an action is created, the swap can be executed.

## Ceramic Signer

This package can be used to sign Ceramic transactions with a PKP using Lit Actions: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/key-did-provider-secp256k1

### Example Application

You can find an example implementation (a React app) of talking to Ceramic and signing with Lit Actions / PKPs here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-action-ceramic-signing-demo

## Sling Protocol

An SDK for automating DEX interactions using PKPs and Lit Actions. Example functionality includes frictionless swaps with signature abstraction
and on-chain limit orders. This project was funded by our Grants program: https://github.com/Sling-Protocol/pkp-dex-sdk

## Conditional Signing

Conditionally signed response using Lit Actions.
Displays the returned JSON if Ether balance >= Min balance entered AND if you signed the transaction within 2 mins of the set time.

## Weather API Signing

Signed Response from Weather API. Within a Lit Action, the example project calls the Weather API and then signs the weather response.
