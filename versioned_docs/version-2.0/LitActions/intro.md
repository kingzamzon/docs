# Introduction

:::note

Lit Actions are still heavily in development and things may change. We're grateful for [feedback](https://forms.gle/4UJNRcQspZyvsTHt8) on how to improve the docs and examples!

To start developing with Lit Actions, check out examples [here](../LitActions/helloWorld.md). For an in-depth review of the functionality provided by the Lit Actions SDK, take a look at our [API docs](https://actions-docs.litprotocol.com/).

## Quick Start

Ready to jump right in? Quickly learn how you can integrate Lit Actions into your own application:

1. Guide: [Hello World with Lit Actions](../LitActions/helloWorld.md)
2. Guide: [Using Lit Actions for Access Control](https://spark.litprotocol.com/using-lit-actions-for-access-control/)
3. Tool: [GetLit CLI](../LitActions/getlitCli)
4. Example Implementation: [Fetching Off-Chain Data in a Lit Action](../LitActions/workingWithActions/usingFetch.md)
5. Example Implementation: [Conditional Signing with Lit Actions](../LitActions/workingWithActions/conditionalSigning.md)

## Overview

Lit Actions are JavaScript programs that can be used to specify signing and authentication logic for [PKPs](../pkp/intro). When used in conjunction with PKPs, Lit Actions are functionally serverless functions with their own private key-pair. Together these tools can be used to write data to blockchains and other state machines.

Every Lit Action gets executed across Litâ€™s threshold cryptography network in parallel, meaning the result of each program is independently verified by each node. Once a threshold of nodes have verified the result (more than two-thirds of network participants), the signing or decryption logic defined therein can be executed.

A trivial example would be a Lit Action and associated PKP that checks if a number is prime, only returning a signature if the number is prime. Each node will execute the Lit Action with a submitted input and verify that it meets the required conditions. If it does, the node will provision an independent key share. Only after more than two-thirds of these shares have been collected can the complete signature be formed.

## Features

1. [Blockchain Agnostic](../resources/supportedChains#programmable-key-pairs.md): Lit Actions can be used to write data to blockchains using PKPs.
2. Immutable: Once a Lit Action has been published, it cannot be modified.
3. Atomicity: Using Mint/Grant/Burn, you can atomically link a PKP to an authorized set of Lit Actions. This method guarantees that a particular PKP can only ever be used to sign data from within the approved set.
4. Off-Chain Compatibility: Lit Actions can pull in data from [off-chain sources](../LitActions/workingWithActions/usingFetch.md) natively, without requiring the use of a third party oracle.


## Examples and Use Cases

2. [Assigning PKP Permissions](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/js-serverless-function-test/blob/main/js-sdkTests/pkpPermissions.js)
3. [Automating verifiable credential issuance](https://spark.litprotocol.com/krebitxlitactions/) 
4. [Executing a trade on Uniswap](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-apps/blob/master/packages/lit-actions/src/to-be-converted/wip-swap.action.mjs?ref=spark.litprotocol.com)
5. [Fetching off-chain price data](https://spark.litprotocol.com/automated-portfolio-rebalancing-uniswap/#how-it-works)
