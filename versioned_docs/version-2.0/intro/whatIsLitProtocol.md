# What is Lit Protocol

Lit Protocol is distributed cryptography for encryption, compute, and programmable signing. As a generalizable key management layer, Lit provides developers with a comprehensive toolkit for managing sovereign identities on the open Web.

## Core Functionality

Lit Protocol provides developers with two core services:

1. Encryption and Access Control: Lit enables the client-side encryption and decryption of data by harnessing on or off-chain conditions, without relying on a centralized key custodian. Use Lit to securely store data on the open Web by getting started with [encryption and access control](accessControl/intro).

2. Programmable Signing: Lit can be used to program complex [signing automations](https://spark.litprotocol.com/automated-portfolio-rebalancing-uniswap/) or provide [seamless wallet onboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeD3RdqAvVM&t=2s) experiences using [Programmable Key Pairs](../pkp/intro.md) (PKPs) and [Lit Actions](../LitActions/intro.md). PKPs are MPC wallets generated and distributed across the Lit network, while Lit Actions are JavaScript functions dictating when, why, and what a PKP wallet will sign. 

## Use Cases

Lit Protocol can be utilized for various web3 applications, including:

- **DeFi**: [Conditional transaction execution](https://spark.litprotocol.com/automated-portfolio-rebalancing-uniswap/), [recurring payments](https://www.notion.so/OSS-tooling-infrastructure-for-recurring-payments-54b01631e4b14a1cb16b20d14641fe2f), liquid staking solutions, and more.
- **Infrastructure**: [Cross-chain bridges](https://github.com/Yacht-Labs/yacht-lit-sdk), oracles for [off-chain data](LitActions/workingWithActions/usingFetch), [privacy-preserving transactions](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/lit-privacy/tree/main/packages/lit-privacy-sdk#readme), and [AA wallet signers](https://spark.litprotocol.com/account-abstraction-and-mpc/).
- **Sovereign Data**: [Verifiable credential issuance](https://spark.litprotocol.com/krebitxlitactions/) and [selective disclosure](https://spark.litprotocol.com/semantic/) for user data.
- **Web3 Social**: [Private data in social apps](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/gated), [token-gated video streaming](https://github.com/suhailkakar/livepeer-token-gated-vod), decentralized chatbots, and on-chain reputation building.
- **Gaming**: [Wallet abstraction](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/oauth-pkp-signup-example), condition-based rewards, and [private data in multiplayer games](https://spark.litprotocol.com/lit-and-web3-gaming/).
- **Token Gating for Web2 Apps**: Token-based access control for [Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/lit-token-access), [Zoom](https://litgateway.com/apps/zoom), [Google Drive](https://litgateway.com/apps/google-drive), and [WordPress](https://litgateway.com/apps/wordpress).
