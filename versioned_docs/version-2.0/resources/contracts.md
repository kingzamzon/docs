# Contracts

Find the full list of the most up to date Lit smart contracts on [Lit's network repository - for the serrano network](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/networks/tree/main/serrano). 

The contracts live on the [Chronicle Testnet](../intro/rollup).



## TypeScript Contracts SDK

The [Lit Contracts SDK](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/js-sdk/tree/master/packages/contracts-sdk) is a bundled package that allows you to make calls to Lit Protocol smart contracts. Some contracts come with additional abstracted functions that can be accessed by appending Util to the contract variable name, for example, pkpNftContract becomes pkpNftContractUtil.
