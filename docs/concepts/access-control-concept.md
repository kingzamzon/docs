# Encryption and Access Control

<StateOfTheNetwork/>

## Overview

Lit Protocol can be used with your storage provider of choice for secure data encryption. With Lit, you can encrypt and decrypt content client-side, defining specific rules for access using [access control conditions (ACCs)](../sdk/access-control/evm/basic-examples).

Both on and [off-chain data](../sdk/access-control/lit-action-conditions) can be used to define ACCs, with examples including encrypting data behind:

- [Membership within a particular DAO](../sdk/access-control/evm/basic-examples#must-be-a-member-of-a-dao-molochdaov21-also-supports-daohaus)
- Ownership of a particular [ERC-721](../sdk/access-control/evm/basic-examples#must-posess-a-specific-erc721-token-nft) or [ERC-20](../sdk/access-control/evm/basic-examples#must-posess-at-least-one-erc20-token) token
- The result of [any smart contract call](../sdk/access-control/evm/custom-contract-calls)
- The result of [any API call](../sdk/access-control/lit-action-conditions), such as a follow on Twitter

To get started building with these tools right away, check out the [SDK install guide](../sdk/installation). Otherwise, keep reading to get a better understanding of the types of use cases decentralized encryption can be used to enable.

## Introduction to Encryption

Encryption is a fundamental application of [public key cryptography](https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). A core building block of modern security infrastructure on the Internet, public key cryptography plays a pivotal role in enabling secure communication and preserving data integrity when we interact online.

At a high level, encryption is the process of transforming some plaintext data into ciphertext using a specialized algorithm. This renders the content unreadable and indistinguishable from random text to anyone without the proper decryption key.


## Exploring Decentralized Access Control with Lit

The Lit network can be used to introduce private and permissioned data to a host of application categories, specifically addressing the “public-by-default” nature of blockchains and storage networks like IPFS. Lit can be applied generally, agnostic to the storage provider being used and desired use case. Possible applications include:

1. **Encrypted wallet-based messaging**: Secure wallet-to-wallet communication without relying on a centralized key custodian.
2. **User-owned social and identity graphs (“self-sovereign data”)**: Empower users with full control over how their personal data is managed on the Web, shifting power away from centralized corporations to individuals.
3. **Credential-gated spaces**: Use token and credential ownership as “keys” to accessing exclusive spaces, content, and experiences, introducing additional utility for digital assets.
4. **Mempool encryption**: This technique can be used to conceal transaction data from Searchers and Block Builders and mitigate the negative externalities of MEV.
5. **Private NFTs**: Release NFTs with private embedded content that can only be accessed by the NFT owner themselves.
6. **Open data marketplaces**: Open data marketplaces facilitate the exchange of data between individuals and organizations, allowing users to buy, sell, or share information in a secure and transparent manner. These systems promote data-driven innovation by making diverse datasets accessible to researchers, developers, and businesses, while also providing data creators with the opportunity to monetize their own content.
7. **Backup and recovery for private key material**: Use Lit to configure robust backup and recovery solutions for private key material (such as multi-factor authentication or social recovery methods), helping users avoid the catastrophic loss of access to their assets due to lost or compromised keys.
