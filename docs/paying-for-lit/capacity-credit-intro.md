# Capacity Credits

Capacity Credits are how you pay for usage of the Lit network. They allow you to reserve a specific amount of capacity (i.e. requests a second) on the network over a pre-defined amount of time (e.g. one week). In order to make requests to the Lit network for things like: signing using a PKP, decrypting data, and executing a Lit Action. You'll need to provide the token ID of an active Capacity Credit along with your request.

Capacity credits are NFT tokens on the [Chronicle Yellowstone](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone.md) rollup blockchain, and can be minted by making a transaction directly to the NFT contract, or by using the Lit Explorer. You can learn more about minting Capacity Credits via a specific method by going to these pages:

- [Minting via the NFT contract](./minting-capacity-credit/via-contract.md)

After minting a Capacity Credit, you'll want to learn [how to delegate usage](./delegating-credit.md) of it to either your users, or yourself via a session.
