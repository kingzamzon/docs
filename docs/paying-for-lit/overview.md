# Paying for Usage of Lit

The Lit networks, like other decentralized networks, manage their computational resources to ensure optimal performance and synchronization across their nodes. To maintain a responsive and balanced network, Lit implements a metering system for resource utilization.

When using the Lit networks, whether it's the decentralized testnet ([Datil-test](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/testnets#datil-test)) or the production-ready mainnet beta ([Datil](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/mainnets#datil)) - you'll need to pay for and reserve your usage. This is accomplished using *Lit test tokens* and *Capacity Credits*.

To streamline the payment process and facilitate integration into your apps, Lit offers two tools: the *Lit Relayer* and the *Payment Delegation Database*. These tools allow you to seamlessly incorporate Lit functionality without burdening your users with the need to acquire Lit test tokens or mint Capacity Credits on their own.

## Payment Methods

### Lit Test Token

Currently the [`testLPX` test token](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone.md#tstlpx-test-token) is the native currency for the Lit [Chronicle Yellowstone](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone.md) rollup blockchain. It's currently used to pay for the gas of on-chain transactions, as well as for minting PKPs and Capacity Credits.

To obtain the `tstLPX` test token, please use [the faucet](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/). The `tstLPX` test token will be sent to your wallet address, allowing you to perform transactions on the rollup.

### Capacity Credits

Capacity Credits are NFT tokens that represent reserved computational capacity on the Lit network. When minting a credit, you specify and pay to reserve a specific amount of requests per second over a period of time. You'll then use these credits when making requests to the Lit network to perform actions such as decryption, executing Lit Actions, and signing transactions using PKPs and Wrapped Keys.

## Tools to Simplify Payment

### Lit Relayer

The Lit Relayer is an [open-source service](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/relay-server) currently hosted by Lit to facilitate onboarding into the Lit ecosystem. It helps reduce initial costs by covering or subsidizing certain interactions with the Lit network, such as minting PKPs.

While the Relayer eases the onboarding process, it's important to note that its availability is not guaranteed. Users may experience rate limiting and/or congestion due to its shared nature.

As your application moves into production, we recommend implementing this functionality directly into your own application instead of using the Lit Relayer. This will ensure that you can use the Lit network with minimal friction and disruptions in service, as your direct implementation will be much more reliable and scalable.

For a deep dive into the Relayer, including its usage and offered services, checkout the in-depth [documentation](./lit-relayer.md).

### Payment Delegation Database

The Payment Delegation Database is a service provided by the Lit Relayer that streamlines payment management for your users. This service offers an alternative to relying on the Lit Relayer's payment subsidies or minting individual Capacity Credits for each of your users. With the Payment Delegation Database, you can establish a Payer Wallet and designate your users as Payees.

The Payer Wallet acts as a central account that manages payment for Lit network usage on behalf of your users (Payees). Payees inherit the reserved capacity of the Payer Wallet, which automatically receives a minted capacity credit when registered with the service.

For a deep dive into the Payment Delegation Database, including how to register a Payer Wallet and add users as Payees, checkout the in-depth [documentation](./payment-delegation-db.md).

### Choosing the Right Payment Method

The Lit network offers various ways to implement payment for usage of the network, accommodating different use cases and application scales. Consider the following guidelines when selecting the most appropriate option for your needs:

#### For New Developers and Initial Testing:
  - Start with the Lit Relayer managing Capacity Credits on your behalf.
  - This option reduces onboarding friction by subsidizing some network interactions.
  - It's ideal for prototyping and early development stages.
  - Note: The Relayer may be subject to availability and potential rate limiting.

#### For Growing Applications:

- As your application grows, transition to managing Capacity Credits yourself.
- This provides more reliable resource allocation and greater control.
- Note: This can become difficult to manage when you have a large user base.

#### For Large-Scale Applications:

- Consider using the Payment Delegation Database to manage delegation of a Capacity Credit to your users.
- This option greatly reduces the overhead of managing several credits for each of your users.
- It's ideal for applications with a large user base or those requiring sophisticated payment management.

Remember, any combination of the above methods can work together or be used independently, depending on your specific use case and development stage. As your application evolves, you can adjust your payment strategy to best suit your needs and those of your users.
