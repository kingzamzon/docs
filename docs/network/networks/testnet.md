# Testnets

Test networks are designed for early-stage application development, for development and testing pre-production. Storing assets with real world value on these networks is highly discouraged and keys may be deleted. All test networks may be deprecated in the future. 

You can set your Lit Network in the [LitNodeClient config of the Lit SDK](../../connecting-to-a-lit-network/connecting), by passing the network name to the `litNetwork` parameter.
