# Mainnet

## Overview

Main networks should be used by applications that are currently live in production, supporting the storage of live assets. Mainnet keys are persistent and will not be deleted. 

You can set your Lit Network in the [LitNodeClient config of the Lit SDK](../../sdk/installation.md), by passing the network name to the `litNetwork` parameter.
