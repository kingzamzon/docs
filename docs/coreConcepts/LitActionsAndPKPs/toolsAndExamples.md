# Initial Implementations

## Ceramic Signer

This package can be used to sign Ceramic transactions with a PKP using Lit Actions: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/key-did-provider-secp256k1

### Example Application

You can find an example implementation (a React app) of talking to Ceramic and signing with Lit Actions / PKPs here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-action-ceramic-signing-demo

## Sling Protocol

An SDK for automating DEX interactions using PKPs and Lit Actions. Example functionality includes frictionless swaps with signature abstraction
and on-chain limit orders. This project was funded by our Grants program: https://github.com/Sling-Protocol/pkp-dex-sdk

## Conditional Signing

Conditionally signed response using Lit Actions.
Displays the returned JSON if Ether balance >= Min balance entered AND if you signed the transaction within 2 mins of the set time.

Below is the complete [**React** project](https://replit.com/@lit/Lit-Actions-Conditional-Signing#lit-actions_sign_api_response/src/App.js).

## Weather API Signing

Signed Response from Weather API. Within a Lit Action, the example project calls the Weather API and then signs the weather response.
