# Adding and Removing Auth Methods

Configure auth methods for your PKP using the [`@lit-protocol/contracts-sdk`](https://js-sdk.litprotocol.com/modules/contracts_sdk_src.html) package.

To write to the blockchain, the `LitContracts` instance must be created with a `ethers.Signer` that is authorized to sign transactions using the PKP. The [`@lit-protocol/pkp-ethers` package](https://js-sdk.litprotocol.com/modules/pkp_ethers_src.html) provides a convenient class, `PKPEthersWallet`, which can be used as a signer.

## Initialize `PKPEthersWallet`

`PKPEthersWallet` must be instantiated with an `AuthSig`, `AuthenticationProps` or a `SessionSig` in order to authorize signing requests. To learn how to generate these signatures, refer to the [Authentication section](../../../../sdk/authentication/session-sigs/intro.md).

Ideally you would want to pass `AuthenticationProps` as it will update `SessionSigs` for you based on current conditions while retaining the benefits of sessions.

You can only pass one of the three. If you pass more than one, `PKPEthersWallet` will throw an exception when constructing or trying to use it.

```js
import { LitNodeClient } from "@lit-protocol/lit-node-client";
import { LitAbility, LitActionResource } from '@lit-protocol/auth-helpers';
import { PKPEthersWallet } from "@lit-protocol/pkp-ethers";
import { LIT_RPC, LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

// If you haven't done before, create a LitNodeClient instance
const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
  litNetwork: LitNetwork.DatilDev,
});
await litNodeClient.connect();

// Prepare needed params for authContext
const resourceAbilities = [
  {
    resource: new LitActionResource("*"),
    ability: LitAbility.PKPSigning,
  },
];

const authNeededCallback = async (params: AuthCallbackParams) => {
  const response = await litNodeClient.signSessionKey({
    statement: params.statement,
    authMethods: [authMethod],
    expiration: params.expiration,
    resources: params.resources,
    chainId: 1,
  });
  return response.authSig;
};

const pkpWallet = new PKPEthersWallet({
  authContext: {
    client: litNodeClient,
    getSessionSigsProps: {
      chain: 'ethereum',
      expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000 * 60).toISOString(),
      resourceAbilityRequests: resourceAbilities,
      authNeededCallback,
    },
  },
  // controllerAuthSig: authSig,
  // controllerSessionSigs: sesionSigs, // (deprecated)
  pkpPubKey: "<Your PKP public key>",
  rpc: LIT_RPC.CHRONICLE_YELLOWSTONE,
});
await pkpWallet.init();
```

To view more constructor options for `PKPEthersWallet`, check out the [API docs](https://js-sdk.litprotocol.com/interfaces/types_src.PKPEthersWalletProp.html).

## Initialize `LitContracts`

Create an instance of `LitContracts` and pass in your `PKPEthersWallet`.

```js
import { LitContracts } from "@lit-protocol/contracts-sdk";

const litContracts = new LitContracts({
  signer: pkpWallet,
});
await litContracts.connect();
```

To view more constructor options for `LitContracts`, check out the [API docs](https://js-sdk.litprotocol.com/classes/contracts_sdk_src.LitContracts.html#constructor).

## Construct the `AuthMethod` Object

To add an auth method, you must pass an `authMethod` object, which should have the following properties:

- `authMethodType`: A number representing the type of auth method you want to add. Refer to the supported auth methods table [here](../../advanced-topics/auth-methods/overview.md).
- `id`: Bytes that represent a hash of a string that uniquely identifies the auth method
- `userPubkey`: Public key of a WebAuthn credential (only required when using WebAuthn as an auth method)

The auth method ID should be a hash of a string that uniquely identifies the auth method. For example, if adding Discord as an auth method, the auth method ID could be a hash of the Discord user ID and your Discord client ID.

```js
import { utils } from "ethers";

// You can fetch the Discord user ID by calling the Discord API: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user
const userId = "<Discord user ID>";
// Upon creating a Discord application, you will be given a client ID: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2
const clientId = "<Discord client ID>";
// The id can be a hash of the Discord user ID and the Discord client ID
const authMethodId = utils.keccak256(
  utils.toUtf8Bytes(`${user.id}:${this.clientId}`)
);
```

## Add an Auth Method

Auth methods can be modified by interacting with the [PKPPermissions contract](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitNodeContracts/blob/main/contracts/lit-node/PKPPermissions.sol). To add an auth method, call the `addPermittedAuthMethod` function on the `PKPPermissions` contract.

```js
const transaction =
  await litContracts.pkpPermissionsContract.write.addPermittedAuthMethod(
    "<The token ID of the PKP you want to add an auth method to>",
    "<The auth method object you want to add>",
    [],
    { gasPrice: utils.parseUnits("0.001", "gwei"), gasLimit: 400000 }
  );
const result = await transaction.wait();
```

The `addPermittedAuthMethod` function takes the following arguments:

- `tokenId`: The token ID of the PKP you want to add an auth method to
- `authMethod`: The auth method you want to add
- `overrides`: An optional object that allows you to customize [certain parameters](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-functionsSend) of the transaction (e.g, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`)

**Note:** Here, we have specified a hardcoded `gasLimit` of `400000`. Users should note that this `gasLimit` is a number which is dependent on the authentication methods being added. For estimating the `gasLimit` specific to your use case, please visit [Estimating Gas](#estimating-gas) section.

Alternatively, you can set a sufficiently high `gasLimit` fee based on your testing and requirements.

## Remove an Auth Method

To remove an auth method, call the `removePermittedAuthMethod` function on the `PKPPermissions` contract.

```js
const transaction =
  await litContracts.pkpPermissionsContract.write.removePermittedAuthMethod(
    "<The token ID of your PKP>",
    "<The auth method type",
    "<The auth method ID>",
    { gasPrice: utils.parseUnits("0.001", "gwei"), gasLimit: 400000 }
  );
```

The `removePermittedAuthMethod` function takes the following arguments:

- `tokenId`: The token ID of the PKP you want to remove an auth method from
- `authMethodType`: A number representing the type of auth method you want to remove. Refer to the supported auth methods table [here](./overview.md).
- `id`: Bytes that represent a hash of a string that uniquely identifies the auth method you want to remove
- `overrides`: An optional object that allows you to customize [certain parameters](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-functionsSend) of the transaction (e.g, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`)

**Note:** Here, we have specified a hardcoded `gasLimit` of `400000`. Users should note that this `gasLimit` is a number which is dependent on the authentication methods being added. For estimating the `gasLimit` specific to your use case, please visit [Estimating Gas](#estimating-gas) section.

Alternatively, you can set a sufficiently high `gasLimit` fee based on your testing and requirements.

## Estimating Gas

To estimate of the amount of gas that would be required to add and remove auth methods, you can first mock the transaction using `populateTransaction` to create an unsigned transaction and then call `estimateGas` on the unsigned transaction.

```js
// First, mock the transaction to add an auth method
const mockTransaction =
  await litContracts.pkpPermissionsContract.write.populateTransaction.addPermittedAuthMethod(
    "<The token ID of the PKP you want to add an auth method to>",
    "<The auth method object you want to add>",
    []
  );

// Then, estimate gas on the unsigned transaction
const gas = await litContracts.signer.estimateGas(mockTransaction);

// Now, you can use the gas value to set the gas limit
const transaction =
  await litContracts.pkpPermissionsContract.write.addPermittedAuthMethod(
    "<The token ID of the PKP you want to add an auth method to>",
    "<The auth method object you want to add>",
    [],
    { gasLimit: gas }
  );
```

## Fetch Auth Methods

To check that the auth method was added or removed successfully, call the `getPermittedAuthMethods` function on the `PKPPermissions` contract.

```js
const authMethods =
  await litContracts.pkpPermissionsContract.read.getPermittedAuthMethods(
    "<The token ID of your PKP>"
  );
```

The `getPermittedAuthMethods` function returns an array of `authMethod` objects, each of which will include `authMethodType`, `id`, and `userPubkey` values.
