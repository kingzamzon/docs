# Minting a PKP

A PKP is a public/private key-pair generated by the Lit Network using Distributed Key Generation (DKG), meaning no one node ever has access to the entire private key. Instead, the private key is stored in shares across the network, where each node holds a single share. In other words, each PKP is functionally a wallet, where the private key lives across the Lit Network.

A PKP is represented as an ERC-721 NFT, and the owner of the NFT becomes the designated “controller” of the Programmable Key Pair. The controller has the ability to assign additional signing logic and [authentication](../authentication/overview) mechanisms to their PKP using Lit Actions.

This section will walk you through the process of creating PKPs using the [V3 SDK](../migrations/3.0.0/overview.md). You can mint PKPs using the following methods:

- [Mint via Contracts](minting-methods/mint-via-contracts)
- [Mint via Social or Email/SMS (OTP) ](minting-methods/mint-via-social)
- [Mint via WebAuthn](minting-methods/mint-via-web-authn)
- [Mint via Multiple Auth Methods](minting-methods/mint-via-multiple-auth-methods)
