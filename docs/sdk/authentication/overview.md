# Overview

:::info
[Habanero Mainnet](../../network/networks/mainnet) and [Manzano Testnet](../../network/networks/testnet) are now live. Check out the [docs on migration](../../network/migration-guide) to learn how you can start building on Habanero and Manzano today.

To interact with the nodes in the Lit Network, you will need to generate and present signatures. Currently, there are three ways to do this:

## Obtain an `AuthSig`

A wallet signature, also referred to as `AuthSig`, is a signature that proves you own a particular public key. Learn more about wallet signatures [here](../authentication/auth-sig.md).

## Generate `SessionSigs` manually

Session signatures, or `SessionSigs`, are signatures that are scoped to specific capabilities and resources. For example, you can set up `SessionSigs` to permit only the encryption and decryption of data during a particular time frame.

`SessionSigs` are designed to be ephemeral and limited in scope, allowing for fine-grained control and enabling secure, seamless interactions with any platform integrating Lit. Get started with `SessionSigs` [here](../authentication/session-sigs/intro).

## Generating `SessionSigs` automatically (Recommended)

When interacting with PKP entities such as PKPEthersWallet or PKPClient, instead of passing `SessionSigs`, you can pass the context to generate them. By doing so, the PKP entity will be able to generate its `SessionSigs` automatically.

This is the recommended way to interact with PKP entities as it will automatically handle refreshing the `SessionSigs` when they expire or network conditions have changed.

:::note

`SessionSigs` are only available on Ethereum and are heavily in development, so things may change. Be sure to use the latest version of the Lit JS SDK.
