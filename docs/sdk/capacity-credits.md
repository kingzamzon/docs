# Capacity Credits

:::info
Currently Rate Limiting is only enabled on `Datil` and `Datil-test`.
See [here](../network/networks/testnet.md) for a list of test networks.
See [here](../network/networks/mainnet.md) for a list of mainnet networks.
:::

# Overview

In order to use Lit, you must reserve capacity on the network. This can be done using capacity credits, which allow holders to reserve a configurable number of requests (measured in requests per second) over a fixed length of time (i.e. one week).

For more information on Capacity Credits and network rate limiting see [here](../concepts/capacity-credits-concept)

## **Minting Capacity Credits**

In order to increase your rate limit, you'll need to mint a `Capacity Credits NFT` on Chronicle - Lit's custom EVM rollup testnet. To do so, you can either use:
1. The [Lit  Explorer](https://explorer.litprotocol.com/get-credits) or,
2. Our `contracts-sdk`.

A `Capacity Credits NFT` can be very easily minted from the Lit Explorer. So, here we will show how you can mint it using `contracts-sdk`. You can download the `contracts-sdk` from `npm` [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/contracts-sdk).

Youâ€™ll also need some `tstLPX` tokens for minting. These are test tokens that hold no real value and should only be used to pay for usage on Datil-test and Datil. `tstLPX` should only be claimed from the verified faucet, linked [here](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/).

```javascript
import { LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

const walletWithCapacityCredit = new Wallet("<your private key or mnemonic>");
let contractClient = new LitContracts({
  signer: dAppOwnerWallet,
  network: LitNetwork.DatilTest,
});

await contractClient.connect();
```

Under the hood, every request is converted to `requestsPerKilosecond`. However, for your convenience, we offer `requestsPerSecond` and `requestsPerDay`, tailored to your usage context.

```js
// this identifier will be used in delegation requests. 
const { capacityTokenIdStr } = await contractClient.mintCapacityCreditsNFT({
  requestsPerKilosecond: 80,
  // requestsPerDay: 14400,
  // requestsPerSecond: 10,
  daysUntilUTCMidnightExpiration: 2,
});
```

In the above example, we are configuring 2 properties
- `requestsPerDay` - How many requests can be sent in a 24 hour period.
- `daysUntilUTCMidnightExpiration` - The number of days until the nft will expire. expiration will occur at `UTC Midnight` of the day specified.

Once you mint your NFT you will be able to send X many requests per day where X is the number specified in `requestsPerDay`.
Once the `Capacity Credit` is minted the `tokenId` can be used in delegation requests. 


:::note
To use your new Capacity Credits NFT you will have to sign an `Auth Signature` with the the wallet which holds the NFT.
:::

## **Delegating Access to your Capacity Credits NFT**

Usage of your Capacity Credits NFT may be delegated to other wallets. To create a `Capacity Credits NFT delegation` you can do so with the following example.

Here we use the `capacityTokenId` we received when minting our Capacity Credit.

```javascript
import { LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
    litNetwork: LitNetwork.DatilTest,
    checkNodeAttestation: true,
});

await litNodeClient.connect();

const { capacityDelegationAuthSig } =
  await litNodeClient.createCapacityDelegationAuthSig({
    uses: '1',
    dAppOwnerWallet: walletWithCapacityCredit,
    capacityTokenId: capacityTokenIdStr,
    delegateeAddresses: [secondWalletPKPInfo.ethAddress],
  });
```
To delegate your Rate Limit NFT there are 4 properties to configure:

- `uses` - How many times the delegation may be used
- `dAppOwnerWallet` - The owner of the wallet as an `ethers Wallet instance`
- `capacityTokenId` -  The `token identifier` of the Rate Limit NFT
- `delegateeAddresses` - The wallet addresses which will be delegated to

### `createCapacityDelegationAuthSig`

There has been some confusion on the parameters for `createCapacityDelegationAuthSig`, particularly `capacityTokenId`, `delegateeAddresses`, and `uses` when delegating capacity credits.

Below is a table detailing the expected behaviors of each:

| Parameter | Provided with Values | Not Provided | Provided but Empty Array |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| capacityTokenId | Scopes the delegation to specific NFTs identified by the IDs in the array. The function will only consider the NFTs whose IDs are listed. | All NFTs owned by the user are considered eligible under the delegation. The delegation applies universally to all NFTs the user owns. | N/A |
| delegateeAddresses | Restricts the use of the delegation to the addresses listed in the array. Only users whose addresses are included can utilise the delegated capabilities. | The delegation is universally applicable to anyone. There are no restrictions on who can use the delegated capabilities. | No one is allowed to use the delegated capabilities since there are no valid user addresses specified. |
| uses | Sets a limit on the number of times the delegation can be used. The function enforces this limit and prevents use beyond it. | There is no limit on the number of times the delegation can be used. The capability can be used indefinitely. | Theoretically, an empty value for uses would mean no uses are possible, effectively disabling the delegation, but typically this scenario should either not be allowed by schema/logic or treated as zero, which also disables the delegation. |

## **Generating Sessions from delegation signature**
To create sessions from your delegation signature you can use the following example.

Here we are delegating usage of `Capacity Credit` from a wallet which possesses the NFT to another self custody wallet which does not posses a `Capacity Credit`.


```javascript
  import { LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

  const DELEGATEE_WALLET = new ethers.Wallet(your_private_key_string, provider);

  const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
      litNetwork: LitNetwork.DatilTest,
      checkNodeAttestation: true,
  });
  await litNodeClient.connect();
  
  const authNeededCallback = async ({ resources, expiration, uri }) => {
    // you can change this resource to anything you would like to specify
    const litResource = new LitActionResource('*');

    const recapObject =
      await litNodeClient.generateSessionCapabilityObjectWithWildcards([
        litResource,
      ]);

    recapObject.addCapabilityForResource(
      litResource,
      LitAbility.LitActionExecution
    );

    const verified = recapObject.verifyCapabilitiesForResource(
      litResource,
      LitAbility.LitActionExecution
    );

    if (!verified) {
      throw new Error('Failed to verify capabilities for resource');
    }

    let nonce = await litNodeClient.getLatestBlockhash();
    let siweMessage = new siwe.SiweMessage({
      domain: 'localhost:3000', // change to your domain ex: example.app.com
      address: DELEGATEE_WALLET.address,
      statement: 'Some custom statement.', // configure to what ever you would like
      uri,
      version: '1',
      chainId: '1',
      expirationTime: expiration,
      resources,
      nonce,
    });

    siweMessage = recapObject.addToSiweMessage(siweMessage);

    const messageToSign = siweMessage.prepareMessage();
    const signature = await DELEGATEE_WALLET.signMessage(messageToSign);

    const authSig = {
      sig: signature,
      derivedVia: 'web3.eth.personal.sign',
      signedMessage: messageToSign,
      address: DELEGATEE_WALLET.address,
    };

    return authSig;
  };

  let sessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getSessionSigs({
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(), // 24 hours
    chain: 'ethereum',
    resourceAbilityRequests: [
      {
        resource: new LitActionResource('*'),
        ability: LitAbility.LitActionExecution,
      },
    ],
    authNeededCallback,
    capacityDelegationAuthSig,
  });
```

In the above example we are configuring a wallet to sign a `session signature` which is delegated access to a `Capacity Credits NFT` which allows another wallet to use the credit for increased network usage.


## **Delegation to a PKP**
To Delegate to a pkp wallet from a wallet which possesses a `Capacity Credit` we can modify the above example as shown below.
For more information on session signatures and pkps see [here](./authentication/session-sigs/intro.md)

```javascript
import { LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

  const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
      litNetwork: LitNetwork.DatilTest,
      checkNodeAttestation: true,
  });
  
    const pkpAuthNeededCallback = async ({
      expiration,
      resources,
      resourceAbilityRequests,
    }) => {
      // -- validate
      if (!expiration) {
        throw new Error('expiration is required');
      }

      if (!resources) {
        throw new Error('resources is required');
      }

      if (!resourceAbilityRequests) {
        throw new Error('resourceAbilityRequests is required');
      }

      const response = await litNodeClient.signSessionKey({
        statement: 'Some custom statement.',
        authMethods: [secondWalletControllerAuthMethod],  // authMethods for signing the sessionSigs
        pkpPublicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,  // public key of the wallet which is delegated
        expiration: expiration,
        resources: resources,
        chainId: 1,

        // optional (this would use normal siwe lib, without it, it would use lit-siwe)
        resourceAbilityRequests: resourceAbilityRequests,
      });

      console.log('response:', response);

      return response.authSig;
  };

  const pkpSessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getSessionSigs({
    pkpPublicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,   // public key of the wallet which is delegated
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(), // 24 hours
    chain: 'ethereum',
    resourceAbilityRequests: [
      {
        resource: new LitPKPResource('*'),
        ability: LitAbility.PKPSigning,
      },
    ],
    authNeededCallback: pkpAuthNeededCallback,
    capacityDelegationAuthSig, // here is where we add the delegation to our session request
  });
  
  console.log("generated session with delegation ", pkpSessionSigs);

  const res = await litNodeClient.executeJs({
    sessionSigs: pkpSessionSigs,
    code: `(async () => {
        const sigShare = await LitActions.signEcdsa({
          toSign: dataToSign,
          publicKey,
          sigName: "sig",
        });
      })();`,
    authMethods: [],
    jsParams: {     // parameters to js function above
      dataToSign: ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.keccak256([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
      ),
      publicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,
    },
  });

  console.log("signature result ", res);

```
