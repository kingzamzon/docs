# Overview

The **Lit JS SDK V3** replaces the existing access control condition based encryption and JWT signing processes with new cryptographic primitives to offer a more secure and seamless user experience.

<StateOfTheNetwork/>

<OldMigrationNotice/>

## Data Migration


:::caution

The Lit development team will not be migrating the access control conditions that have been "stored" in the `jalapeno` and `serrano` networks but we will continue to maintain support for them for a finite period of time. Therefore, we will request users to migrate to `Datil` and `Datil-test` networks.

:::

If you wish to continue using these access control conditions for encryption or signing JWTs, please continue using the V2 SDK. But we strongly recommend users to migrate to V6.4 SDK as it supports our new networks, `Datil` and `Datil-test`, which are not supported by V2 SDK.

Alternatively, here are some general instructions for migrating to use the new encryption scheme:

1. Decrypt from the original network (`jalapeno` or `serrano`) to retrieve the plaintext that was encrypted at rest.
2. If this plaintext corresponded to a symmetric key that you had used to encrypt data, then you would need to retrieve and decrypt the encrypted data.
3. With the plaintext data now, you can use the new encryption scheme in the SDK V3 and store this encrypted data wherever you wish.


:::info
Note that the time and feasibility of this migration process ultimately depends on how your application is integrated with Lit.
:::

Some factors that have different implications on the migration timeline include:

- Whether a single symmetric key is used for encrypting all of your users' data, vs. using a symmetric key per each user's encryption needs
- Whether a different symmetric key for each type of data is used (even for the same user), vs. using a symmetric key across all types of data
- Whether a single storage engine is used to store encrypted data, vs. a multitude of storage engines are used

## Per-Package Changes

### `@lit-protocol/encryption`

All of the methods now require `ILitNodeClient` in the function argument.

### `@lit-protocol/lit-node-client` and `lit-node-client-nodejs`

All of the functionality for encrypting and decrypting private data is now implemented by the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods.

All of the functionality for obtaining a BLS network signature over a JWT is now implemented by the `getSignedToken` method.

### `@lit-protocol/bls-sdk`

:::note

You should only use this package if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, please use `@lit-protocol/encryption` as a higher-level helper library.

:::

#### Encryption

Previously in V2, you would have to:

- Generate a symmetric key
- Encrypt private data using this symmetric key
- Encrypt this symmetric key using the BLS network key
- Save this encrypted symmetric key with some access control conditions in the BLS network

Now in V3, all you would have to do is to call the `encrypt` method to perform client-side encryption:

```javascript
const publicKey =
  '8e29447d7b0666fe41c357dbbdbdac0ac8ac973f88439a07f85fa31fa6fa3cea87c2eaa8b367e1c97764800fb5636892';

const secretMessage = new Uint8Array([
  240, 23, 185, 6, 87, 33, 173, 216, 53, 84, 80, 135, 190, 16, 58, 85, 97, 75,
  3, 192, 215, 82, 217, 5, 40, 65, 2, 214, 40, 177, 53, 150,
]);

const identityParam = new Uint8Array([
  101, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95, 100, 101, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95,
  119, 111, 114, 107, 115,
]);

const ciphertext = blsSdk.encrypt(
  publicKey,
  uint8arrayToString(secretMessage, 'base64'),
  uint8arrayToString(identityParam, 'base64')
);
```

#### Decryption

Previously in V2, you would have to:

- Make a request to the BLS network for decryption shares
- Combine decryption shares using `blsSdk.combine_decryption_shares` to get a decryption key
- Use this decryption key to decrypt the ciphertext

Now in V3, you can use the `verify_and_decrypt_with_signature_shares` method after obtaining BLS network signature shares:

```javascript
const privateData = blsSdk.decrypt_with_signature_shares(
  ciphertext,
  sigShares
);
```

The signature shares must be obtained via the new BLS network endpoint.

#### Signature Verification

Previously in V2, you would have to call the `verify` method.

Now in V3, you can use the `verify_signature` method. The signature must be combined using signature shares obtained via the new BLS network endpoint.

### `@lit-protocol/crypto`

:::note

You should only use this package if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, please use `@lit-protocol/encryption` as a higher-level helper library.

const secretMessage = new Uint8Array([
  240, 23, 185, 6, 87, 33, 173, 216, 53, 84, 80, 135, 190, 16, 58, 85, 97, 75,
  3, 192, 215, 82, 217, 5, 40, 65, 2, 214, 40, 177, 53, 150,
]);

const identityParam = new Uint8Array([
  101, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95, 100, 101, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95,
  119, 111, 114, 107, 115,
]);

const ciphertext = encrypt(publicKey, secretMessage, identityParam);
```

#### Decryption

Previously in V2, you would have to:

- Make a request to the BLS network for decryption shares
- Combine decryption shares using `combineBlsShares` to get a decryption key
- Use this decryption key to decrypt the ciphertext using `decryptWithSymmetricKey`

Now in V3, you can use the `verifyAndDecryptWithSignatureShares` method after obtaining BLS network signature shares:

```javascript
const ciphertext =
  'l9a/01WDJB/euKxtbWcuQ8ez/c9eZ+jQryTHZVLN0kfd7XHoLs6FeWUVmk89ovQGkQJnnFDKjq6kgJxvIIrxXd9DaGuRBozLdA1G9Nk413YhTEqsENuHU0nSa4i6F912KltE15sbWKpDfPnZF6CA2UKBAw==';
const signatureShares = [

);

## Notable Changes

V3 includes the following breaking changes from V2.

### Supported Lit Networks

Both `jalapeno` and `serrano` will no longer be supported. Now, `datil-dev`, `datil-test` and `datil` are the only supported networks and we will be moving forward with them.

### Types

#### Removed Types

- `EncryptedString`
- `ThreeKeys`
- `JsonStoreSigningRequest`
- `JsonSaveEncryptionKeyRequest`

#### Updated Types

- `DecryptZipFileWithMetadata`
- `VerifyJWTProps`
- `IJWT`
- `SuccessNodePromises`
- `DecryptFromIpfsProps`
- `LIT_NETWORKS_KEYS`

### Methods

#### Removed Methods

The following methods have been removed from `LitNodeClientNodeJs` and `LitNodeClient`:

- `getChainDataSigningShare`
- `storeSigningConditionWithNode`
- `saveSigningCondition`
- `getSigningShare`
- `getDecryptions`
- `getSignedChainDataToken`

#### Updated Methods

The following methods have their interfaces updated in `LitNodeClientNodeJs` and `LitNodeClient`:

- `combineSharesAndGetJWT`

THe following methods have their names updated in `@lit-protocol/encryption` and `@lit-protocol/lit-node-client-nodejs`:

- `decryptFile` becomes `decryptToFile`
- `decryptString` becomes `decryptToString`
- `decryptZip` becomes `decryptToZip`

All method interfaces in `@lit-protocol/encryption` have been updated.

## Minting Capacity Credits for Usage

Currently Rate Limiting is enabled on `Datil` and `Datil-test`. In order to use these networks, you must reserve capacity on them by minting a `Capacity Credits NFT` on Chronicle - Lit's custom EVM rollup testnet. Capacity credits allow holders to reserve a configurable number of requests (measured in requests per second) over a fixed length of time (i.e. one week). For minting capacity credits, you can either use:
1. The [Lit  Explorer](https://explorer.litprotocol.com/get-credits) or,
2. Our `contracts-sdk`.

A `Capacity Credits NFT` can be very easily minted from the Lit Explorer. For minting Capacity Credits using `contracts-sdk` see [here](../../capacity-credits.md).

Youâ€™ll also need some 'tstLPX' tokens for minting. These are test tokens that hold no real value and should only be used to pay for usage on `Datil` and `Datil-test`. `tstLPX` should only be claimed from the verified faucet, linked [here](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/).

For more information on Capacity Credits and network rate limiting see [here](../../../../docs/concepts/capacity-credits-concept.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Using Next.js

If you are using **Next.js ^12**, you may encounter the following [error](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/28774):

```bash
Module build failed: UnhandledSchemeError: Reading from "node:buffer" is not handled by plugins (Unhandled scheme).
```

Implement the [following workaround](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/28774#issuecomment-1264555395) in your `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Your Next.js config
  // ...
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/^node:/, (resource) => {
        resource.request = resource.request.replace(/^node:/, "");
      })
    );
    return config;
  },
};
```

### Using Create React App (CRA)
If you are using CRA you may see the errors related to `stream`, `buffer`, `crypto`, `http`, `https`, `url`, `zlib`, `jszip` and `assert` to being found / handled. You can fix this with the following webpack override

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack'); // Import webpack

module.exports = {
	webpack: function(config, env) {
		// Add a fallback for 'crypto' in the resolve object
        config.resolve = {
            ...config.resolve, // Spread existing resolve configurations
            fallback: {
                ...config.resolve.fallback, // Spread existing fallbacks, if any
                'crypto': require.resolve('crypto-browserify'), // Fallback for 'crypto'
                'stream': require.resolve('stream-browserify'), // Fallback for 'stream'
                'buffer': require.resolve('buffer/'), // Add this line
                'http': require.resolve('stream-http'), // Add this line
                'https': require.resolve('https-browserify'), // Add this line
                'url': require.resolve('url/'), // Add this line
                'zlib': require.resolve('browserify-zlib'), // Add this line
                'jszip': require.resolve('jszip/'), // Add this line
                'assert': require.resolve('assert/'), // Add this line
            },
        };

        // Provide plugin to define Buffer globally
        config.plugins = [
            ...config.plugins,
            new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
                Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer'],
            }),
        ];

		config.module.rules = config.module.rules.map(rule => {
			if (rule.oneOf instanceof Array) {
				rule.oneOf[rule.oneOf.length - 1].exclude = [
					/\.(js|mjs|jsx|cjs|ts|tsx)$/,
					/\.html$/,
					/\.json$/,
				];
			}
			return rule;
		});
		return config;
	},
}; 
```

In the above we are replacing `stream`, `buffer`, `crypto`, `http`, `https`, `url`, `zlib`, `jszip` and `assert` with browser compatible replacements.
We also modify the default Create React App's `module rules` to include other JavaScript file extensions.

You may need to install [react-app-rewired](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired) to override the webpack confgiuration with the above.
for usage with the above package you can change your run script

```json
"scripts: {
  ...
  "start": "react-app-rewired start",
}
```
