# Package Changes

The **Lit JS SDK V3** replaces the existing access control condition based encryption and JWT signing processes with new cryptographic primitives to offer a more secure and seamless user experience.

<StateOfTheNetwork/>

## `@lit-protocol/bls-sdk`

:::note

You should only use this package if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, please use `@lit-protocol/encryption` as a higher-level helper library.

### Encryption

Previously in V2, you would have to:

- Generate a symmetric key
- Encrypt private data using this symmetric key
- Encrypt this symmetric key using the BLS network key
- Save this encrypted symmetric key with some access control conditions in the BLS network

Now in V3, all you would have to do is to call the `encrypt` method to perform client-side encryption:

```javascript
const publicKey =
  '8e29447d7b0666fe41c357dbbdbdac0ac8ac973f88439a07f85fa31fa6fa3cea87c2eaa8b367e1c97764800fb5636892';

const secretMessage = new Uint8Array([
  240, 23, 185, 6, 87, 33, 173, 216, 53, 84, 80, 135, 190, 16, 58, 85, 97, 75,
  3, 192, 215, 82, 217, 5, 40, 65, 2, 214, 40, 177, 53, 150,
]);

const identityParam = new Uint8Array([
  101, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95, 100, 101, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95,
  119, 111, 114, 107, 115,
]);

const ciphertext = blsSdk.encrypt(
  publicKey,
  uint8arrayToString(secretMessage, 'base64'),
  uint8arrayToString(identityParam, 'base64')
);
```

### Decryption

Previously in V2, you would have to:

- Make a request to the BLS network for decryption shares
- Combine decryption shares using `blsSdk.combine_decryption_shares` to get a decryption key
- Use this decryption key to decrypt the ciphertext

Now in V3, you can use the `verify_and_decrypt_with_signature_shares` method after obtaining BLS network signature shares:

```javascript
const privateData = blsSdk.decrypt_with_signature_shares(
  ciphertext,
  sigShares
);
```

The signature shares must be obtained via the new BLS network endpoint.

### Signature Verification

Previously in V2, you would have to call the `verify` method.

Now in V3, you can use the `verify_signature` method. The signature must be combined using signature shares obtained via the new BLS network endpoint.

## `@lit-protocol/crypto`

You should only use this package if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, please use `@lit-protocol/encryption` as a higher-level helper library.

const secretMessage = new Uint8Array([
  240, 23, 185, 6, 87, 33, 173, 216, 53, 84, 80, 135, 190, 16, 58, 85, 97, 75,
  3, 192, 215, 82, 217, 5, 40, 65, 2, 214, 40, 177, 53, 150,
]);

const identityParam = new Uint8Array([
  101, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95, 100, 101, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 95,

];

const plaintext = verifyAndDecryptWithSignatureShares(
  publicKey,
  identityParam,
  ciphertext,
  signatureShares.map((s) => ({
    ProofOfPossession: s,
  }))
);
```

## `@lit-protocol/encryption`

All of the methods now require `ILitNodeClient` in the function argument.

## `@lit-protocol/lit-node-client` and `lit-node-client-nodejs`

All of the functionality for encrypting and decrypting private data is now implemented by the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods.

All of the functionality for obtaining a BLS network signature over a JWT is now implemented by the `getSignedToken` method.
