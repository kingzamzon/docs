# Decrypting within a Lit Action


## Overview

Decryption with Lit can be performed client-side by an authorized user, but it can also be performed within a Lit Action.

Lit Actions have two methods for decrypting data: `decryptToSingleNode` and `decryptAndCombine`. The former reduces the execution scope of the Lit Action to a single node and decypts the data there. The latter collects each Lit node's decryption share, combines them, and then decrypts the data.

When `decryptToSingleNode` is used, the execution scope being reduced to a single Lit node means that any behavior that requires multiple nodes (i.e. console logs, `signAndCombineEcdsa`, etc...) will encounter a timeout error.

Using decryption within a Lit Action is useful for performing operations over sensitive data, where the data itself remains private within the confines of each Lit node's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). You can learn more about Lit's architecture [here](../../resources/how-it-works#sealed-and-confidential-hardware.md).

The below example will demonstrate encrypting an API key client-side, decrypting it within a Lit Action, and using the decrypted API key to query the blocknumber on Base.

## Prerequsites
- Knowledge of [SessionSigs](../authentication/session-sigs/intro)
- Basic understanding of [Lit Actions](../serverless-signing/quick-start)
- Intermediate understanding of Lit [Encryption and Decryption](../access-control/quick-start)

## Complete Code Example
The complete code example is available in the [Lit Developer Guides Code Repository](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/tree/master/decrypt-api-key-in-action/nodejs).

### Example Lit Action

The `decryptAndCombine` function uses the `accessControlConditions` to specify who and under what conditions the data can be decrypted. The `ciphertext` and `dataToEncryptHash` are the encrypted data and the hash of the data that was encrypted.

We set the `authSig` to null as a way to tell the Lit Action runtime to use the `authSig` which was provided to the node when you call `executeJs`. It will use the AuthSig within the session signatures. 

Then our decrypted API key is used to query the blocknumber on Base.

```tsx
const _litActionCode = async () => {
  try {
    const apiKey = await Lit.Actions.decryptAndCombine({
      accessControlConditions,
      ciphertext,
      dataToEncryptHash,
      authSig: null,
      chain: "ethereum",
    });

    const fullUrl = url + apiKey;

    const resp = await fetch(fullUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        id: 1,
        method: "eth_blockNumber",
        params: [],
      }),
    });

    let data = await resp.json();

    if (data.result) {
      data.result = parseInt(data.result, 16);
    }

    Lit.Actions.setResponse({ response: JSON.stringify(data) });
  } catch (e) {
    Lit.Actions.setResponse({ response: e.message });
  }
};

export const litActionCode = `(${_litActionCode.toString()})();`;
```

## Summary

This guide demonstrates how to use Lit Actions to decrypt data within a Lit Action.
