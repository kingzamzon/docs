# Decentralized Compute with Lit Actions

Lit Actions are immutable JavaScript programs that run on a decentralized Lit network. They enable powerful, blockchain-agnostic applications with built-in cryptographic capabilities like signing and encryption.

## What Makes Lit Actions Different

Lit Actions are a paradigm shift in decentralized computation, offering a flexible and powerful tool for creating sophisticated decentralized applications. Here's some of what makes them unique:

- **JavaScript-Based**: They're written in JavaScript, executed in a secure Deno environment, and support the importing of third-party libraries such as [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js).
- **Blockchain Agnostic**: Unlike traditional smart contracts, Lit Actions can interact with multiple blockchains, allowing for cross-chain applications and broader interoperability.
- **Off-Chain Capabilities**: Lit Actions can make HTTP requests and interact directly with off-chain APIs, eliminating the need for complex oracle systems.
- **Programmable Signing**: Through integration with [Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)](../../user-wallets/pkps/overview.md), Lit Actions enable custom and automated, condition-based signing.
- **Decentralized Execution**: Lit Actions run on the distributed Lit Network, ensuring high availability and resistance to censorship.
- **Stateless but Stateful**: While Lit Actions themselves are stateless, they can interact with both on-chain and off-chain state, enabling new application designs not available using existing blockchains like Ethereum.

## Example Lit Action Implementation

To illustrate the power and flexibility of Lit Actions, let's consider a practical example:

 > A Lit Action that signs a transaction only if the reported temperature for a specific area is below a defined threshold.

###### How it would work:

1. The Lit Action fetches temperature data from three different weather APIs.
   - The choice of using three APIs is arbitrary, but demonstrates how data from multiple sources can be fetched from within a single Lit Action.
2. It calculates the average temperature from the these sources.
3. If the average temperature is below a predefined threshold, the Lit Action uses a Programmable Key Pair (PKP) to sign a transaction that transfers tokens on a blockchain.
4. The signed transaction can be broadcasted to the blockchain network immediately, or returned for later submission.

###### This example showcases how Lit Actions can:

- Interact with on and off-chain APIs/RPCs
- Perform computations and make decisions using fetched data
- Use PKPs for conditional signing

## Use Cases

Below are a couple examples of how Lit Actions can be leveraged:

- **Cross-Chain DeFi:** Automate trades or manage portfolios across multiple blockchains.
- **Decentralized Access Control**: Create dynamic, condition-based access to digital assets or data.
- **Automated Governance**: Implement complex voting mechanisms or proposal execution across DAOs.
- **Decentralized Oracles**: Fetch, process, and provide verified off-chain data to smart contracts.
- **NFT Utilities**: Create dynamic NFT metadata or automate royalty distributions.
- **Privacy-Preserving Computations**: Perform computation without exposing sensitive data.

## Getting Started

You can create your first Lit Action by following this [Quick Start](../serverless-signing/quick-start.md) guide. Below, you'll find some additional resources and example implementations:
