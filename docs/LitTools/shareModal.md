# Share Modal

The Lit Share Modal is a tool for creating access control conditions for securing content with Lit Protocol.

- Secure content based on wallet address, token/NFT holdings, POAP ownership, or DAO membership.
- Create multiple paths for unlocking content by using AND/OR operators.
- Set your most used tokens/NFTs as defaults for quick and easy access.

## Usage in React

Use this UI library to allow users to setup custom blockchain based access control. This library can be used in any React app.

A playground for experimenting with the modal is available here: https://lit-share-modal-v3-playground.netlify.app/.

## Usage in Vanilla JS (No React)

A version of this library without React will be available soon.

[//]: # (To use this library without React, you can use the following package, which wraps the react library up in vanilla JS.)

## Usage in Next.js

If you are using NextJS, the CSS injection will not work. Set the `injectCSS` prop to false, and import the CSS file directly from `node_modules/lit-share-modal-v3/dist/ShareModal.css` in `_app.tsx` or `_app.jsx`.
More information is available in the docs.  https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-share-modal-v3.
