# SearchLit Explorer

Use the [SearchLit Explorer](https://searchlit.io/) (built by the [Lore](https://www.lorescan.com/new/networks) team) to simplify development on Lit!

With SearchLit, you can view all of the on-chain activity on [Chronicle](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle), including your token balances, verified contracts, top addresses, transactions, and more. 

SearchLit also supports the creation of custom notifications (based on on-chain events) and an intuitive support interface powered by AI.
