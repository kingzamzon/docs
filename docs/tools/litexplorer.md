# Lit Explorer

The Lit Explorer is a tool designed to help developers get started with Lit Protocol.

By signing in with either a Coinbase or MetaMask account, developers can use the Explorer to view the [PKPs](../user-wallets/pkps/overview) and [Capacity Credits](../sdk/capacity-credits) minted to their account.

Additionally, the Explorer provides chain details for [Chronicle](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle) and [Chronicle Yellowstone](../connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone), as well as the contract addresses for each chain.

To check it out, visit the [Lit Explorer](https://explorer.litprotocol.com/).
