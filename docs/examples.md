### Minimal JWT verification example to gate dynamic content on a server

This repo is a minimal example to:

- Mint an NFT (client side)
- Provision access to a resource (a web url) behind ownership of that NFT (client side)
- Request a signed JWT from the Lit network to access that resource (client side)
- Verify the signature on that JWT (server side)

### Minting HTML NFTs

An example that showcases the ability to mint an HTML NFT with locked content that only the NFT owner can decrypt or see.
