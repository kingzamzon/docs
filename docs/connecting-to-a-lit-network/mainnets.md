# Mainnets

Lit mainnets are designed for late-stage development and production deployment. If you are storing assets with real world value, it should be done on the mainnets and not the testnets. While mainnets may be deprecated in the future, assets will be transferable to new networks.


Here is an overview of the Lit mainnets:

| Name       | Lit Blockchain                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Minimum Lit SDK Version | Lit SDK Network Identifier | Requires Payment |

## Datil

The Lit network, Datil, utilizes the Lit blockchain: Chronicle Yellowstone. It's a decentralized mainnet designed for production deployment, and is superseding the Habanero mainnet. Like Habanero, usage of the network **does** require payment using [Capacity Credits](../sdk/capacity-credits).

If your application is currently deployed to a v0 Lit network (Cayenne, Manzano, and/or Habanero) please refer to [this guide](migrating-to-datil) to learn how to migrate to the new Datil networks.

The minimum version of the Lit SDK that supports `datil` is `6.4.0`, and the latest SDK version will be installed from NPM by default:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @lit-protocol/lit-node-client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @lit-protocol/lit-node-client
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There were no breaking changes to the API for `v6` of the Lit SDK, so the code you were using for Habanero should work without issue on Datil. If you do run into issues after migrating to Datil, please reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/+aa73FAF9Vp82ZjJh) for support.

To connect to Datil, please follow the [Connecting to a Lit Network](./connecting) guide using `datil` for the `litNetwork` property when instantiating an instance of the `LitNodeClient`.
