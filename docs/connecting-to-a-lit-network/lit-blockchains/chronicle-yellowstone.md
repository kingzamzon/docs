# Chronicle Yellowstone

Chronicle Yellowstone is Lit Protocol's custom EVM rollup which is superseding the [Chronicle](./chronicle.md) blockchain, allowing for a more performant and stable backend for Lit's infrastructure.

## About Chronicle Yellowstone

Chronicle Yellowstone is a custom EVM rollup using [Arbitrum Orbit](https://arbitrum.io/orbit), designed specifically for Lit Protocol. This rollup is the primary platform for coordination, minting PKPs (programmable key pairs), and managing PKP Permissions. Note that PKPs minted on Chronicle Yellowstone can still sign transactions on any chain supported by Lit, including EVM, Cosmos, and Bitcoin.

## `tstLPX` Test Token

The `tstLPX` test token serves as the gas for transactions on Chronicle Yellowstone. Please note that this is a test token with no real-world value. Its purpose is exclusively for testing and development on the Lit Protocol platform.

To obtain the `tstLPX` test token, please use [the faucet](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/). The `tstLPX` test token will be sent to your wallet address, allowing you to perform transactions on the rollup.

Keep in mind that the official Lit Protocol token is scheduled to launch sometime in the future. This will be the actual token with real-world utility within the ecosystem.
